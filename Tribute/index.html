                Florence Nightingale was a pioneering British nurse, statistician, and social reformer who is considered the founder of modern nursing. Born on May 12, 1820, in Florence, Italy, she was raised in a wealthy family but was drawn to helping others, despite her family's objections. In 1844, she began training as a nurse at the Institution of Lying-In in London, and later at the Kaiserswerth Institute in Germany.<br> During the Crimean War, she led a team of nurses to Turkey, where she improved sanitation and care at the British Army Hospital in Scutari, significantly reducing mortality rates. Her work and writings, including her famous book "Notes on Nursing," established her as a leading authority on nursing and hospital reform.<br>
                She continued to advocate for improved healthcare and statistics until her death on August 13, 1910, leaving a lasting legacy in the field of nursing and beyond.
